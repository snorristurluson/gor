# README #


The purpose of this repository is to develop and maintain the GOR help.

There is one .rst file for each GOR command. Documentation on the reStructured Text format can be found [here](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html).

[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) is then used to render html pages. Sphinx can be installed with `pip install Sphinx` and an introduction to Sphinx can be found [here](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html).
