/**
 * Created by villi on 24/08/15.
 * <p>
 * Wrapper around a stream source.
 * <p>
 * If it detects consecutive range opens - it opens a full ranged stream
 * on the underlying datasource. Subsequent range requests will be served from the full range
 * stream as long as within a (forward) seekable range.
 * <p>
 * Rationale:
 * When most remote/high latency stream sources get a request to open a stream specifying start position and length,
 * they will issue a ranged request to the remote source mirroring the requested position/length.
 * <p>
 * The Genomic Iterators typically use a buffer size of 64-128kbytes so each request will be of that size.
 * In general, there are two reaons for a requests: Seeks and sequential reads/scans.
 * <p>
 * For seeks - the iterators are taking a peek at certain location - normally seeking back and forth to search for a location.
 * In this case we want to minimize the request size.
 * <p>
 * For sequential reads, the iterators are iterating and reading through a larger range which will result in multiple
 * consecutive small requests which will suffer on connections with higher latency.
 * If we instead open a full range request behind the scenes and serve smaller requests from that, we get the benefit of TCP windowing and
 * streaming from the server to the client.
 * <p>
 * (NB - This is generally not a problem on low latency links (like local or lan filesystems - which in addition have buffering and read-ahead).
